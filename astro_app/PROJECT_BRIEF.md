# Astrology App — Brief for Astrologer Consultation

## Platform
Single codebase, browser + mobile (web app, installable on phones). Not native iOS/Android code.

Stack in use: React + TypeScript (Vite), computed client-side. Planetary positions come from `astronomy-engine` (a pure JS/TS ephemeris library, no WASM/native build step — chosen over Swiss Ephemeris for this prototype specifically for that portability). Capacitor wrapping for app-store distribution is still a good option later but not done yet.

## Chart style
User-selectable — South Indian (square, fixed houses) and North Indian (diamond) layouts, same underlying data.

## Charts required
- Rasi (D1) chart
- All divisional charts (Navamsa/D9, Dashamsa/D10, Hora/D2, Drekkana/D3, etc. — full set)
- Bhava charts

## Dasha system
Vimshottari.

## House system
Whole sign.

## Inputs
Date of birth, time, place → compute chart (planetary positions sourced via Swiss Ephemeris / JPL-grade data).

## V1 feature scope
1. Birth chart generation (all divisional + bhava charts, both regional styles)
2. Matching/compatibility (synastry between two charts)
3. Transits (current planetary positions vs. natal chart)
4. Daily predictions

Note: all four of the above are in scope for v1 — not a narrow "birth chart only" start.

## UI
Editable via buttons and drag-and-drop (e.g., repositioning planets/labels on the chart). Logic and rules to be defined by astrologer; UI/interaction handled by engineering.

## Build status (prototype, v0)

Code lives in `astro_app/web` (React + TypeScript + Vite). Run with `npm install && npm run dev` from that folder.

**Working end-to-end:**
- Birth-details form: date, time, place (curated South Indian/major-city list + custom lat/long), correct historical time-zone resolution (`tz-lookup` + `luxon`, not just today's offset).
- Sidereal chart engine: geocentric tropical planetary longitudes (`astronomy-engine`) → Lahiri ayanamsa → sidereal longitudes, Ascendant/Lagna, whole-sign houses, nakshatra + pada per planet, retrograde detection.
- Divisional charts implemented: **D1 (Rasi), D2 (Hora), D3 (Drekkana), D9 (Navamsa), D10 (Dashamsa), D12 (Dwadashamsa)** — selectable from the UI.
- Chart rendering: both **South Indian** (fixed 4x4 grid) and **North Indian** (diamond, house-based) styles, toggle between them.
- Drag-and-drop: planet chips can be dragged between houses in either chart style (touch + mouse, via `dnd-kit`) — for testing alternate placements; not persisted anywhere yet.
- Vimshottari dasha: full mahadasha sequence with nested antardashas, computed from the Moon's nakshatra position at birth.
- Verified running end-to-end in a real browser (Chromium), including the drag interaction.

**Needs the astrologer's sign-off before it's trustworthy, in priority order:**
1. **Ayanamsa formula** — currently a linear approximation to Lahiri/Chitrapaksha (anchored at J2000, ~50"/year drift), not the full Swiss Ephemeris precession model. Likely accurate to within an arcminute, but should be checked against a few known charts. See `web/src/astro/ayanamsa.ts`.
2. **Remaining divisional charts** — D4, D6, D7, D16, D20, D24, D27, D30, D40, D45, D60 are not implemented yet. Several (e.g. D3, D7) have more than one traditional counting method — need the astrologer's preferred rule for each before encoding them.
3. **North Indian house orientation** — implemented clockwise from the top; sanity-checked against an Aries-ascendant case (natural sign order should read clockwise) but worth a final visual confirmation.
4. **Lunar node choice** — using the mean lunar node (Rahu/Ketu), not the "true" (osculating) node. Confirm this is the intended convention.

**Not started (out of v0, but in the agreed v1 scope):** matching/compatibility (synastry), transits, daily predictions. These are the next build phase once the chart math above is validated — no point building predictions on top of a chart engine that hasn't been checked yet.
